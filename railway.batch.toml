# 1. Go to Service Settings → Build
# 2. Set "Config File Path" to: railway.batch.toml
# OR
# 3. Manually configure the Dockerfile path to: Dockerfile.batch

[build]
builder = "dockerfile"
dockerfilePath = "Dockerfile.batch"

[deploy]
# Batch service runs cron jobs, so no specific start command needed
# The Dockerfile's ENTRYPOINT handles the startup
